# Neural-Network

A collections of Various projects or applications and tools developed using Neural-Networks.

- [Digit Recognizer](digit-recognizer/): An implementation and comparison of various neural network models on MNIST dataset for digit recognition using [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) library.

  - Models Implementated: 
    - Feed Forward Neural Network (VANILLA)
    - Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN/LSTM)
    - Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BRNN)
    - Multi Column Deep Neural Network (CNN)
    - Vote Multi Column Deep Neural Network (CNN)
  
- [Sentiment Analysis](Sentiment-Analysis): Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data using Word2Vec, FastText and Universal Sentence Encoder in [Keras](https://keras.io)

Results:
  - word2vec - ~ 67%
  - fastText - ~ 67%
  - Universal Sentence Encoder - ~ 77%
